This open source software solves a limitation in the Waze GPS app by allowing it to open (most) Google Maps URLs.

I wrote it because was annoyed with the bug they did not fix this bug in almost a year.
So I solved the problem myself.

What it does is convert google maps URLs like:

http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.561522,-46.656101

to waze URLs like

waze://?ll=-23.561522,-46.656101&navigate=yes

I parsed the the AndroidManifest from Google Maps to make sure I can accept everything google maps accepts.

Special thanks for Nobel for having this app's idea.
